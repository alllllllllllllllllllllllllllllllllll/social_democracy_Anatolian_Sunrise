One crucial value shown in this tab is the attitude of TSK(acronym for the Turkish Armed Forces) towards the general status of the nation and their belief in the democratic framework. The head of the general staff is crucial in the sense that even though they cant prevent or conduct coups on their own, they can determine the nature of a coup done by the military hierarchy, for an example if a coup only has the purpose of resetting the political status or to reshape the democratic mechanisms as a whole. In that sense even though they are supposed to not take part in the political matters, the head of the armed forces can influence the future of the nation greatly. Turkey\'s 1970\'s in real life ended with a bloody coup in 1980 and such a scenario may repeat itself if the army loses belief in the ability of the current system to effectively rule the nation, and if the root causes that carried the nation to such a terrible outcome aren\'t resolved.

The key parameters displayed here are the inter-party relations which affect all aspects of the game, the party leaderships which display the ideologies that direct the decisions and attitudes of the various political parties, Kurdish nationalism which shows both how widespread Kurdish nationalism is among the Kurdish population and how violent it is against the state framework, union relations which shows how close our ties are with the labour movement and what whether left wing(DİSK) or right wing(TÜRK-İŞ) syndicates are more influential, municipalities control which shows how many provinces are governed by our mayors and the intra-party cliques within the party. All of these parameters need to be observed and managed carefully."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The \'Defense\' tab shows the status of the paramilitary organizations that hold influence over the streets and the level of political violence, decided upon by the percentage of the state control over the streets compared to those of the far right and the far left groups. The objective of the player is not to empower either the far right or the far left but to resolve the political violence that if unsolved may be a huge milestone towards a military intervention. The police forces aren\'t immune to politics neither and their loyalty to the parliamentary and republican framework will need to be kept in check. If the street fightings become unmanagable, it will damage both our party and the rest of the parliamentary framework greatly and may prevent many of our political capabilities.
