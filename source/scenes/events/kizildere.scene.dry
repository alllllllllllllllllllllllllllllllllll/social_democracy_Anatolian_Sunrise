= The Battle of Kızıldere

It was long anticipated that the rest of the Marxist Leninist organizations would be making a move to prevent the execution of the caught leader of THKO, Deniz Gezmiş. However what was not anticipated is that they would be able to abduct several foreigners from a military base to force the state's hand.

It quickly falls to the news that THKP-C, the last remaining Leninist organization within the country led by Mahir Çayan, has abducted several foreigners, namely from the United Kingdom and Canada and has called the state to let them broadcast their message through the state radio, TRT. Or else the foreigners would be killed.

After extensive searches, the THKP-C militants were spotted in the village of Kızıldere, a small settlement in the rural municipality of Niksar. Within hours the state forces and the police surrounded the village and demanded that the militants surrender themselves and the abductees, or else they would open fire.

After the refusal of the terrorists to surrender and their execution of the foreigners, the police has opened fire and almost all the militants were found found dead by the time the sun set.

With this skirmish, THKP-C has begun disintegrating and likely won't be able to make a return.
