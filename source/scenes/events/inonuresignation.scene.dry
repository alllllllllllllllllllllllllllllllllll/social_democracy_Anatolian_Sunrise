"By being elected as the chairman of CHP, I do not consider myself to have replaced İnönü. Bay İnönü's place is above all titles and is constant and unreachable"

"Ingrate!" said İnönü's wife, Mehribe Hanım.

After a short silence, İnönü called out to his visitors around him;

- @resignation: "He is just like Menderes. Sensuality combined with ambition lead one to disaster. **May Allah protect our nation**"
- @staying: Perhaps change is a nature of life. Even if I can not agree with his vision, I will not stand in his way. I hope his election proves beneficial for the nation.
