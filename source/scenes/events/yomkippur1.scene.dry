= Yom Kippur War

The drums of war have begun beating once again in the heart of the Middle East. After the recent Sinai Crisis between Egypt and Israel and Israel's refusal to submit to the Arabic demands of total withdrawal, the Arabian states have striken rapidly and decisively against the young Jewish State once again.

The Egyptian and accompanying Syrian armies have been reported to have achieved several minor successes in the border towns and several skirmishes. While a crisis that we dont want to endulge ourselves in, it nevertheless has the potential to shake up the status quo across the whole region.

And the Middle East marches into war once again, once again making many commentators question whether permanent peace in the Levant is possible at all.
