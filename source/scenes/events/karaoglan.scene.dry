Şehzade Şahin was a lady in her late 30's sustaining herself and her family with farming, wasting herself in the fields many hours a day so that her family can survive the conditions they didn't choose but were forced into. In the heat of August, or during the freezing colds of December, it didn't really matter. All that mattered was that constant work was required to feed and take care of the family, and she didn't care about the rest.	

Her husband, Aydın Bey was a close affiliate of İnönü and she even saw him, such a supposedly illustrious figure a few times. However the times were changing and it was obvious that İnönü was lagging behind, unable to provide the hope for the future that the masses were expecting from CHP.

A young man named Bülent was rising within the party and many including her found their hope in him. After winning the leadership, Ecevit's first visit happened to be to Kars and she was all too eager to meet him.

Upon Aydın Bey's invitation, Bülent and his wife Rahşan decided to pay a little visit to the small village. Upon seeing him, a slightly dark skinned man with a  light blue shirt, Şehzade hugged the man and said to him; ”Save us from these dark days, Karaoğlan(black boy)!“. Though unintentional, beginning with the local newspapers writing about the event, the nickname has started to spread across Anatolia like wildfire and is on everyone's tounge now.
