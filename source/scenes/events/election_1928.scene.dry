The Grand National Assembly elections are to be held now.

Since we are currently ruling as part of an emergency government, we may use quasi-constitutional trickery to significantly delay these elections, and continue governing via Article 48. This is likely to be extremely unpopular both with our base and with the other parties. However, this may be necessary to prevent the extremists from gaining power.

- @cancel_elections_2: Yes, do it.
- @election_algorithm: No, let's hold the elections.

Fine. President [+ president +] has taken the unprecedented step of canceling these elections. New elections are scheduled for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

Even though the MSP is very reluctant to participate in such a coalition, they still accede to President Hindenburg's wishes. Thus, a majority center-right coalition is formed, with BrÃ¼ning as chancellor.

President Hindenburg has decided that Franz von Papen will continue as chancellor while the Reichstag remains deadlocked. Papen proposes to govern by decree until new elections can be held.

- @new_elections: Force immediate elections instead.

Despite the clear lack of parliamentary support, Hindenburg is still relying on Papen. His authoritarian instincts are becoming more obvious, and the far right celebrates the paralysis of Parliament.

- @new_elections: Demand fresh elections once again.


@no_majority_schleicher
title: Schleicher seeks a new path.
on-arrival: no_majority_schleicher_seen = 1

General Kurt von Schleicher claims he can stabilize the Republic with a technocratic cabinet backed by presidential powers. Many democrats fear that this is merely another step toward dictatorship.

- @coalition_menu: Explore any remaining parliamentary options.

@no_majority_CHP
on-arrival: chancellor = "BrÃ¼ning"; chancellor_party = "AP"

There is no path to an obviously workable majority. Since President Hindenburg is unwilling to work with a minority or caretaker CHP government, his preferred chancellor is Heinrich BrÃ¼ning of the Center Party, who could lead a "presidential" government.

There is no path to a majority government. President Hindenburg is tired of the chaos, and appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor instead of BrÃ¼ning. Papen is a indenpendent formerly from the Center Party, and is significantly to the right of the majority of the Center Party.

Papen is immediately faced with a vote of no confidence, given his unpopularity. However the CHP votes, he is guaranteed to fall, due to the unanimous hatred against him from all other parties.

There is no path to a workable Reichstag majority or minority government. The next elections are set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

The people's faith in democracy is shaken by this ordeal. Of course, the Nazis are exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Germany needs a strong leader.

A grand coalition between the left wing CHP and right wing AP would be unprecedended, however it may be the solution to the the political instability that has been ravaging our nation.

Since we have emerged as the largest party from the election, president [+ president +] has asked us to lead the government. 

Even though a national unity coalition with AP is highly unpopular in the party, the fact that we will lead the government has eased the worries of many. Now we have to agree on a prime minister.

Are we sure about not participating in government? This will cause significant internal dissent, and will lead to increased distrust from the bourgeois parties. Even debating this option causes internal backlash. In addition, it is possible that the bourgeois and right-wing parties will also be unable to form a coalition government, leading to a regime appointed by President [+ president +].

Since the remaining bourgeois and right-wing parties cannot form a tolerable governing agreement, new elections have been called for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +]. The previous chancellor has resigned, and has been replaced by Heinrich BrÃ¼ning, also of the Center Party, ruling as part of a presidential cabinet. 

We are seen as responsible for the failure to form a government, and many of our middle-class and even some working-class supporters have deserted the party.

We can pick from any number of ministries. Controlling a ministry allows us to directly effect policy in that area.
