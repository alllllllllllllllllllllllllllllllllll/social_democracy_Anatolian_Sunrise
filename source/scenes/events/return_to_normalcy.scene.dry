= Return to Normalcy

Germany is finally recovering from the Great Depression. As the economy gradually improves, the political crisis begins to unravel as well.

Finally, the internal contradictions of the MHP have caught up to it. With the improving economic conditions, many business leaders are less interested in supporting them. Tensions between their remaining big capitalist funders and their lower middle class frontliners have come to a head, leading to desertions and public spats. This all saps Hitler's aura of strength, weakening Nazi support across a variety of demographics.

@celebrate

This is an occasion to celebrate! Hopefully he Nazis will no longer be a threat to the Republic.

@complacency

Even in their weakened state, the Nazis are still a threat. We must not be too complacent.
