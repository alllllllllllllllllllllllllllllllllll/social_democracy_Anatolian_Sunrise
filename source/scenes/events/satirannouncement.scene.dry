= Extraordinary Party Congress announcement

In response to the rising Left of Center movement, Kemal Satır has called for an extraordinary party congress to deal with those "Who want to sway <span style="color: #E3000F;">**CHP**</span> away from its Kemalist roots."

İnönü has reluctantly accepted the proposal and our party is heading towards its perhaps most crucial congress in decades, one that will decide the fate of both the party and the nation.
