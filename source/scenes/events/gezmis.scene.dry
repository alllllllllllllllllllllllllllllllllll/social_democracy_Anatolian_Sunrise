= The Trial of the Three Saplings

"The Three Saplings" refers to the former leaders of the Marxist Leninist militant group, THKO, who were caught last year days after the 1971 Memorandum. The Judiciary already having decided on their execution, CHP has rejected the ruling and called for a vote in the parliament over the decision of the courts.

Gezmiş and his friends had begun their revolt with the purpose of "forming a new state" as they call it, and the expulsion of "American Imperialism" that they claim has infiltrated every branch of the state.

TBMM is in a state of chaos. Delegates from AP shout from their chambers, "Three from us, three from them!" referring to the former Right wing prime minister Menderes and two of his ministers who were executed after the 1960 coup. CHP is divided on the issue, with the right preparing to vote for their execution while surprisingly İnönü has supported Ecevit's call for a cancel of the execution with the following statement;

"The penalty of the culprits should be turned to life sentence. These men, are younglings in essence and inexperienced. The state has already shown them and their alikes that their excesses will not give any results."

Ecevit has risen up in his seat made these comments in response to the right winger calls for their immediate execution;

"I am against the death penalty as a principle. However today the reason I am calling for the spare of the lives of Deniz Gezmiş, Yusuf Asland and Hüseyin İnan is not my principal rejection of capital punishment. As long as the death sentence exists within the laws, I am aware that my rejection of it in the basis of principals will be futile.

"My speech has no relation to having good emotions or having positive opinions for the young men. I dont know any of these men. I have never agreed with the opinions of any of them. I have never approved their actions. Leave approving it aside, I have always raised my voice consistently higher than anyone else against their beliefs and actions. My primary reason for calling for the sparing of the lives of these young men is this: No matter the severity of their crimes, there are different and bigger culprits of these crimes than them. These young men have been incited, played over with and pulled into various traps. Many of those who are behind these incitements, those who have prepared these games and traps are free and are seen of high status. There have been no searches towards them. Here their sins are desired to be buried with the lives of a few young men. That is injustice. History cant bear this great injustice, and one day shall remove the curtain..."

As it stands, the judicial decision is likely to be approved as CHP stands divided and AP, except for a few deserters, is fully united before the execution.

Shall the voting begin?

The voting has concluded. The fate of Gezmiş and his friends is now sealed by the will of the parliament.

- @execution_result: The parliament has voted to ratify the death penalty.
- @commuted_result: Perhaps through sheer miracle, the parliament has voted to cancel the death penalty! While they will be tried once again, it's made certain that they will not be executed.

Dad;

By the time this letter reaches you, I will be dead. I know that you will be saddened no matter how much I would tell you to not. However I want you to face this situation with fortitude. People are born, they live, and they die. What is important is not to live long, but to live meaningfully. For this reason I dont regret going away this quickly and my friends who have gone the same path before never feared death. You can be sure that I wont fear it either. Your son is not helpless or desparate in the face of death. He went through this path willingly and he knew that this would be his end. Our beliefs are different, however I think you will understand me. And not only you, I believe the entire Turkish and Kurdish peoples living in Turkey will do so too. I gave the necessary orders for my funeral to my lawyers. Also I will tell the prosecutor too. I want to be buried in Ankara alongside my friend Taylan Özgür who died in 1969. For this reason dont try to take my funeral to İstanbul. Its up to you now to comfort my mom. I am leaving my books to my little brother. Warn him especially, I want him to become a man of science. He shall work with science and should never forget, working for science is too in some way service for humanity. 

I would like to express I have no regrets for what I did in the end, and I salute you, my mother, my older brother and younger brother with the burning passion of my revolutionarism.

Your son Deniz Gezmiş - Central Prison

The Socialists are grateful for us saving Gezmiş's life and many intellectuals visit Ecevit's office over the weeks and months for his support.
