= Right Wing Resignations

For years, since the coup of 1960 a battle has been waging between the reformists who wished to reposition CHP as a Social Democratic party and the old guard which hoped to stall or even prevent such a transformation that they saw as a betrayal of the values of Kemalism.

However, the resolution of this long-lasting conflict seems to be approaching.

With Ecevit's victory in his conflict with İnönü on the chairmanship, the Left of Center has emerged as the triumphant faction within the party. With the rapid transformation of the party and its executive, the Right Kemalists have chosen to abandon CHP and carve out a separate path to offer a 'national' alternative to the Social Democratic CHP appearing in the horizon.

Roughly 30 delegates, led by Kemal Satır first and foremost, have collectively handed over their resignation to Chairman Ecevit and are currently independents, though we expect them to reach an agreement with CGP and its leader Turhan Feyzioğlu to merge their political paths very soon.
