= Right Kemalist delegates join CGP
  
2 Months ago, as a reaction to Ecevit's victory in the party congress, Right Kemalists had handed their resignations to the new leadership and become independents to pursue a separate political agenda. 

Today however their undetermined position in the parliament seems to have come to an end. After an hours long meeting between the leaders of the splitters such as Kemal Satır and the chairman of CGP, Turhan Feyzioğlu, an agreement has been reached to merge the temporary party(CP, Republican Party) formed by the independent delegates and Feyzioğlu's party(GP, Trust Party) into CGP, or the Republican Trust Party.

Largely a continuation of the GP in terms of its organization and Nationalist/Corporatist rhetoric, CGP has ostensibly solidifed itself as a right wing alternative the new Social Democratic CHP.
