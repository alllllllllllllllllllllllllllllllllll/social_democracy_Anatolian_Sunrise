= A New Turkey

The Republican People's Party, CHP, stands at a historic crossroads. Since the formation of the republic in 1923, <span style="color: #E3000F;">**CHP**</span> has always been the representative of progressive and republican values within the nation. However with the switch to a multi party democracy at the end of the 40's, our party has struggled greatly with representing the values of Kemalism and progress against the rising tide of anti revolutionary forces. Many within the party have tied this situation to the elitist stance of the party, wanting to transform the people in the context of their static interpretation of westernism and civilazition. 

The reformists within the party have decided to put an end to this wrong elitist attitude and to transform Atatürk's party into what it once was, the party of progress and civility before the people who understood Atatürk and Kemalism not through the values it represents, but only through the persona of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. 

Among the reformists, a new and dynamic figure, Bülent Ecevit arises. A young poet and former minister of labour, he is rallying the voices calling for a change within the party against the incumbant party leader İsmet İnönü, who has been leading the party since Ataturk's fade into the lights in 1938.

Due to İnönü's indifference and even approval of the military intervention last year in 1971, Ecevit has resigned from the post of party secretary which he previously held and is preparing a grassroots movement against İnönü so that <span style="color: #E3000F;">**CHP**</span> can once again become the hope and beacon of progress within the nation and at last, once again, become the party of **the people**.

Things may very well blow up within the two sides soon and the following decade of the republic will be determined. Between the claws of the dove and the edge of the bayonet.
