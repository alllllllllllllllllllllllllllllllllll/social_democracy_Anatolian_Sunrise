= Orhan Eyüboğlu

Orhan Eyüboğlu is the vice secretary of the CHP and is in support of İnönü. With a stance favoring party discipline, he seeks reconciliation between the reformists and the old guard.

- @orthodoxdissent: Even though favoring İnönü, Eyüboğlu isn't inherently against Ecevit's position and prioritizes party stability over petty ideological differences. 
- @partyorganization: Having served as the vice speaker of the party, Eyüboğlu can help manage the party organizations.
- @localgovernence: Eyüboğlu has served as the governor of İstanbul between 1963 and 1968. His experience can prove beneficial for managing our municipalities efficiently.
