= Municipalities and local governence

In Turkey, the territories of the republic are divided among small municipalities which are firmly connected with the central government. Still, the municipalities are stil an integral part of Turkish politics and are useful for reaching out to demographics we normally aren't performing well through an example of our governence and services.

- @governence: Municipalities are responsible for many local tasks in which we can improve our performance and show to the people how a CHP government would look like.
- @politics: The municipalities not only allow us to offer a vision of our administration but also to perhaps improve our political standing through the usage of local resources.

@governence
choose-if: party_dissent < 15
unavailable-subtitle: The party dissent is too high! We are unable to influence our local governments to improve our efficiency.

- @waterlines: Urban municipalities often struggle with sewage management and providing clean water. 
- @publictransport: Public transport is a crucial part of urban life and most cities are lacking.
- @libraries: City libraries can be built to support education and increase literature consumption.
- @halkekmek: Municipal bakeries, organized under the programme "Halk Ekmek" can produce affordable bread to combat inflation and support worker families.
