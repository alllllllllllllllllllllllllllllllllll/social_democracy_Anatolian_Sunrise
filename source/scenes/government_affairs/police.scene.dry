@loyalty
on-arrival: police_loyalty += 0.1

There are measures we can take to unveil the ideological cliques, prioritizing the advancement of their ideology to the wellbeing of the state, within the police forces. We can improve training and recruiting procedures, and identify and remove known extremists and the like.

Current interior police loyalty: [+ interior_police_loyalty : loyalty +]

@recruit
on-arrival: police_strength += 8; police_loyalty -= 0.05

The new police regiments strengthen the state's hold over the streets, though we have been reported of a decrease in general loyalty.

@weaponry
subtitle: -1 budget
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough budget.
choose-if: budget >= 1
 on-arrival: police_militancy += 0.1; budget -= 1

The police forces have been supplemented with better weapons and trainings, improving their efficiency.

@investigate_corruption
go-to: investigate_corruption_success if police_loyalty >= 0.5; investigate_corruption_failure if police_loyalty < 0.5

@investigate_corruption_success
on-arrival: investigate_corruption += 1; workers_chp += 5*(1-dissent); inflation -= 0.1 if inflation > 3; inflation -= 0.2 if inflation >= 8

Corruption in big business is rampant, of course. We have uncovered a number of scandals, and publicizing them brings new attention to the work of Interior Minister [+ interior_minister +], building up his popular appeal and that of the CHP.


@investigate_corruption_failure

Unfortunately, our investigations have failed to turn up anything. Rumors are that the targets of our investigation were tipped off by infiltrators within the police.

@investigate_far_right
go-to: investigate_far_right_success if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.55; investigate_far_right_failure if interior_police_loyalty < 0.55

[? if investigate_far_right == 1 : We have discovered collusion between Hjalmar Schacht, president of the Reichsbank, and the Nazis. This is very useful information. ?]
[? if investigate_far_right == 2 : We have discovered illegal arms smuggling by the SA, the Nazi paramilitary. ?]
[? if investigate_far_right == 3 : We have discovered a secret cache of documents from the MHP detailing their plan to violently take over the country if they enter into power. This is an anti-constitutional plot, and will be publicized and persecuted. ?]
[? if investigate_far_right > 3 : Of course the Nazis are doing crimes; everyone knows that. Now, we finally have proof. ?]

[? if coup_progress >= 6: There are reports of an imminent coup by the far-right. We have attempted to disrupt some of these plans, but the threat is still present. ?]

@easterncrime
choose-if: police_loyalty >= 0.50 and police_force >= 55 and eastern_crime > 0
subtitle: The economic problems, largely due to the huge rates of crime and smuggling, in the East constitute a significant factor in the rise of Kurdish Nationalism.
unavailable-subtitle: [? if police_loyalty <= 0.49 : Our police forces are too disorganized and unloyal for such operations. ?][? if police_force <= 54 : Our police forces aren't strong enough to enforce the law against organized crime in the East! ?][? if eastern_crime < 0 : Large scale crime has already been exterminated in the East. ?]
on-arrival: police_militancy -= 0.08; eastern_crime -= 1; kurds_chp += 3

[? if eastern_crime >= 4 : We have raided some drug depots in the border regions, however more work is needed to solve the issue altogether. ?]
[? if eastern_crime = 3 : Continuous raids and operations in the East has begun waining the power of the local gangs! ?]
[? if eastern_crime = 2 : The crime rates have been decreased significantly thanks to the determination of the security forces. ?]
[? if eastern_crime = 1 : The region has largely been neutralized, with only isolated incidents remaining as remnants of past instability. ?]
[? if eastern_crime = 0 : The region has been completely neutralized; the region at last enjoy lasting order and stability. Many are grateful at our party for ending the lawlessness which has persisted for centuries. ?]

@ohal
choose-if: OHAL = 0 and state_force_percent <= 49 or year >= 1978 
subtitle: Though a drastic move and something we are ideologically opposed to, we may be forced to declare a state of emergency and and restrict the civil rights in order to bring peace to the streets.
unavailable-subtitle: The situation in the streets still can be managed through conventional means.
on-arrival: grey_wolves_militancy -= 0.1; grey_wolves_strength -= 8; dev_yol_militancy -= 0.1; dev_yol_strength -= 8; raiders_strength -= 8; workers_chp -= 5; rural_chp -= 3; state_employees_chp -= 3; petty_bourgeoisie_chp -= 3; kurds_chp -= 3; alevis_chp -= 3; OHAL += 1

Our voters are deeply irritated by our decision to initiate the militarization of the streets when we were the party promising to stop it. Ecevit's persona as the uncorrupted fighter for democracy breaks down as we resort to pragmatic actions we normally despise. However, hopefully this will be worth it for the motherland.
