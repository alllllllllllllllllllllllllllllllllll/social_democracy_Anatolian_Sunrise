#subtitle: Building relations with the other political parties of Germany.

= Inter-Party Relationships

The <span style="color: #E3000F;">**CHP**</span> cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. Even though we are somewhat isolated from the other political parties, inter-party dialogue is still important for the democratic framework. We can reach out and build additional connections with these other parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.
	
- @liberals: Strengthen our bonds with our splinter party CGP
- @center: Strengthen our bonds with the AP
- @TIP: Work towards improving relations with the Socialist movement
- @MSP: Perhaps we can try contacting MSP?
- @chp_alone: The <span style="color: #E3000F;">**CHP**</span> can stand alone for now.

@grassroots
on-arrival: TIP_relation += 6*(1 - dissent)  

Since TIP is currently banned, many Socialists welcome our attempts to create a political platform for them. Grassroot connections also expose our party to the socialist ideals..

@demsoc
on-arrival: TIP_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)	

Mehmet Ali Aybar's TIP is ideologically close with us and its only natural that we improve our relations.
	
@commie	
on-arrival: TIP_relation += 4*(1 - dissent)
	
The ideological turn TIPO has taken is incompatible with ours and this makes attempts at improving our relations less efficient.

@antimilitary	
on-arrival: z_relation += 6*(1 - dissent)	
	
Even though we have our political differences, both of our party leaderships want to get rid of the military influence and our commitment to race in fair terms is what unites us.	

@enemies	
on-arrival: z_relation += 3*(1 - dissent)

Since the common enemy that used to unite us went into the shadows, we now have no reason to cooperate as the polar opposites of the Turkish politics. However, we can still try fostering connections.

on-arrival: resources -= 1; CGP_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)
	
Though they seem uninterested in cooperation, they are still the closest party to us ideologically on the right.

@surprising	
on-arrival: MSP_relation += 4*(1 - dissent)	

Despite the fact that Islamists are normally our arch enemies, MSP in a strange position where they are rejected by both the liberals of the right and the Kemalist establishment. For this reason, we have managed to form some connections that normally wouldn't be thought of as feasible. 	

@coalition	
on-arrival: MSP_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)	

We are stuck in a coalition with them, and it may be the best choice to maintain cordial relations.	

@hellnah	
on-arrival: MSP_relation += 2*(1 - dissent)	

Currently there is little incentive for stronger ties between the two parties.

@chp_alone

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

- @return: Continue...
