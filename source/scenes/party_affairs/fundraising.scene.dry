= Fundraising

For better or for worse, the party cannot exist without money.

- @maintain: Maintain our current dues.
- @reduce: Reduce dues.
- @increase: Increase dues.

@maintain
subtitle: [+ dues +] resources gained.[? if socialist_international_member : (+1 from Socialist International) ?]
on-arrival: resources += dues; resources += 1 if socialist_international_member

We maintain our current dues.[? if socialist_international_member : Our membership in the Socialist International provides additional funding through international solidarity contributions. ?]

@reduce
subtitle: [+ dues - 1 +] resources gained.[? if socialist_international_member : (+1 from Socialist International) ?] This will lower our periodic resource gain.
choose-if: dues > 1
on-arrival: dues -= 1; resources += dues; resources += 1 if socialist_international_member; kemalist_marxists_dissent -= 8; left_kemalists_dissent -= 8; orthodox_kemalists_dissent -= 8; right_kemalists_dissent -= 8

Our current members appreciate this, but no one decides to join a party because of the low dues.[? if socialist_international_member : Our membership in the Socialist International provides additional funding through international solidarity contributions. ?]

@increase	
choose-if: party_dissent >= 5
unavailable-subtitle: Our party dissent is not low enough to warrant a due increase. [? if not health_economy_status = "Booming" : Especially when our members are struggling to feed their families! ?]
subtitle: [+ dues + 1 +] resources gained.[? if socialist_international_member : (+1 from Socialist International) ?] [? if unemployed >= 15 : Given the present economic situation, this may be painful. ?][? if dues >= 4 : Dues are already rather high; increasing them might reduce our membership. ?]
on-arrival: dues += 1; resources += dues; resources += 1 if socialist_international_member; kemalist_marxist_dissent += 10; left_kemalists_dissent += 10; orthodox_kemalists_dissent += 10; right_kemalists_dissent += 10; workers_chp -= 3; rural_chp -= 2

Our members grumble at this, and some of the less committed members leave. But now, we have access to additional resources.[? if socialist_international_member : Our membership in the Socialist International provides additional funding through international solidarity contributions. ?] 

[? if unemployed >= 15 : Because of the presently high unemployment, our members are feeling the extra burden hard. ?]
