= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The rising urban working class, attracted by our shift in policy. 
- @petty_bourgeoisie: The middle class of artisans, shopkeepers and alike, normally affiliated with liberal parties.
- @state_employees: Citizens employed by the state and bureaucracy.
- @rural: Rural workers and small farmers, who have felt neglected by us in the past.
- @alevis: The Shiite minority that is generally grateful for saving them from the grasp of the Sunni Ottomans. 
- @kurds: Kurds, who lack a mainstream political affiliation
- @capitalists: Perhaps we can try to maintain our dissolving ties with the industrialists and the landlords..?
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.

We have increased our campaigning among the workers. [? if unemployed >= 15: The high levels of unemployment make our campaign more difficult. ?][? if wtb_adopted = 1 : Adopting the WTB plan gives us a new rallying point around which to attract workers. ?]

We have increased our campaigning among the new middle class. [? if socialism <= 49 and peoples_party == 0: The popular antipathy towards socialism among this group makes our campaign more difficult. ?] [? if peoples_party > 0: As a people's party, we have an easier time increasing support among the middle class than before. ?]

on-arrival: left_kemalists_dissent += 5; kemalist_marxists_dissent += 10; capitalists_chp += 1; resources -= 1

Not only does trying to appease the capitalists as a leftist party fail horribly, the Marxist and Left Kemalists disapprove of this action greatly.

@root

We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.
