= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The rising urban working class, attracted by our shift in policy. 
- @petty_bourgeoisie: The middle class of artisans, shopkeepers and alike, normally affiliated with liberal parties.
- @state_employees: Citizens employed by the state and bureaucracy.
- @rural: Rural workers and small farmers, who have felt neglected by us in the past.
- @capitalists: Perhaps we can try to maintain our dissolving ties with the industrialists and the landlords..?
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.
- @easy_discard
